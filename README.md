# Dependency Visualizer CLI

A simple command-line tool to analyze and visualize dependencies in TypeScript and JavaScript projects. This tool scans your project files, identifies imported modules, and checks for unused dependencies.

## Features

- **Detect Imports**: Analyzes `.ts` and `.js` files to list all imported modules.
- **Identify Unused Dependencies**: Compares imports against your project's dependencies to identify any that are not used.
- **Built with Bun**: Utilizes Bun's API for file handling and SWC for code analysis, ensuring fast and efficient execution.

## Installation

3. Run `bun install` to install the dependencies

## Usage
